By Ifeanyi Nwoko The Senate is set to begin hearing on a petition urging it to look into the moribund state of the Ajaokuta Steel Company and the National Iron Ore Mining Company. Following the directive of the senate at plenary, the Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public petition has fixed March 22 for the hearing. Recall that Sen. Ahmed Ogembe (Kogi Central) had brought the petition written by Kogi Stakeholders before the red chamber. The petitioners had urged the senate to intervene and ensure that the two national assets in the state are revived. While presenting the petition, Sen. Ogembe urged the Senate to do something urgently before the two assets will become completely moribund. The Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki after listening to the petition, referred it to Senate committee on ethics, privileges and public petitions. The hearing will hold March 22 at room 120, new senate building by 3 P.M. In an interview with our correspondent said that the hearing would provide an ample opportunity for his people to speak out. He expressed optimism that the revelation from the hearing would bring lasting solution to the problems. “Yes, I have spoken several times on issues that relates to Ajaokuta but I think this hearing would  provide an ample opportunity for our  people especially stakeholders in this sector to speak for themselves and settle disputes,”. “The minister will also be in attendance, so, whatever decisions or resolutions arrived at by the Senate committee on ethics, privileges and public petition will move us forward,” he added.
