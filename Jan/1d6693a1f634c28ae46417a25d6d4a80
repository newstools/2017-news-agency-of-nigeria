The comptroller said that currently 17 foreigners were serving various jail terms in Adamawa prisons. He said the command lost four staff, 121 staff members promoted and generated over N80 million as revenue. “Despite these modest achievements in 2016, the command couldn’t tap its full potential due to some challenges such as: inadequate logistics, permanent office structure and accommodation for both senior and junior staff alike. “However, the command will do its best in offering prompt and efficient services to those that will be in need of our facilities ; which will include foreigners and Nigerians alike”, Wunti said.
